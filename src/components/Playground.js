/*
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Rules of STATE ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
  - We create a slice of state like this: `const [healthPoints, setHealthPoints] = useState(100)`
  - A component may have as may slices of state as it needs
  - A slice of state may contain a string, a number, a boolean, an array, an object...
  - We use slices of state to store information that changes as the user interacts with the app
  - State is used in the JSX interpolated inside curly brackets
  - We never tamper with state: `healthPoints++`, `healthPoints--` or `someState.push(item)` is FORBIDDEN
  - We use the dedicated "state updater" to schedule a state change: `setHealthPoints(healthPoints + 1)`

import React, { useState } from 'react'

/* State:
React has a hook called useState()
  - helps keep track of data

  - Need to import it using {useState}

  useState() syntax:
    const [arg1, setArg1] = useState(arg2)

      arg1 = variable used in JSX
      setArg1 = is a callback function to change or update the state
      arg2 = what the state starts with - the initial value

export default function Playground(prop) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const { cohort } = prop
  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <h1>{cohort} is currently learning React! </h1>
      <div>The count is {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => { setCount(count + 1) }}>Add to Count</button>
    </div>
  )
}



/* Q+A:
What happens when the index.js App gets long?
- normally you would invoke functions to the App in the index.js from other js files

What does 'export default' on line 14 do?
- To export the Playground component without needing to import it with the curly brackets around it
